Supermarket Sales Forecasting & Smart Restocking System
This project is a complete data science solution focused on optimizing inventory management in a supermarket by forecasting product demand and restocking quantities. The primary goal is to reduce product wastage, especially for items with limited shelf life, and improve operational efficiency through predictive analytics.

📊 Key Features
Sales Prediction: Uses historical data to forecast monthly sales of individual products.
Restocking Insights: Recommends optimal restocking quantities to prevent overstocking or stockouts.
Product Category Analysis: Identifies the best and worst-performing categories across time.
Monthly Sales Trends: Visualizations to track seasonal or monthly fluctuations in product demand.
Outlier Detection & Cleaning: Ensures data quality through preprocessing techniques like IQR filtering.
Model Comparison: Evaluates multiple regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest) based on RMSE, MAE, and R² score to find the most reliable predictor.

🔍 Tech Stack
Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
Machine Learning: Regression models for forecasting
EDA & Visualization: Histograms, box plots, correlation heatmaps, bar charts
